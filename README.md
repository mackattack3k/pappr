Random full screen wallpaper fetch from subreddits.

### Account access

You have to login to reddit with an account since I don't want to deploy a backend for this
project. This also means that you are rate limited on an account basis.

We only require read
access which means that we can "read" subreddits and comment with your account. We can't post
or use your account in any other way.

## Todo

- [ ] Show hyperlink to current wallpaper reddit post
- [ ] Handle non image posts
- [ ] Allow user to change what subreddits to use
- [ ] Maybe cache?
